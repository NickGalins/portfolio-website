  <h2>Everything is a story</h2>
  <p>From the architecture of your documentation to the emotion in your brand voice, every touchpoint
  is a narrative waiting to be defined. I treat content as a unified ecosystem, ensuring your message
  is clear, consistent, and human.</p>

  <p>I operate as an all-inclusive writer for the future of business, using AI-forward workflows to
  amplify human insight and efficiency. I don't just fill a slot on a team; I adapt to the context
  and tools at hand to create content that works. </p>

  <p>Whether you need clarity in your UI/UX, narrative behind
  your data, or emotion in your copy, I ensure the "story" lands.</p>
