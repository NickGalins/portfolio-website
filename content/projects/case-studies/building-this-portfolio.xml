  <summary>
    This case study explores the decisions behind building this portfolio site. As a multidisciplinary writer spanning Content Design, Technical Writing, and Narrative/Game Writing, I needed a portfolio structure that could adapt to different hiring contexts without pigeonholing my work into a single specialty. I also used this project as an opportunity to document my AI-forward development workflow.

         SECTION 1: THE CHALLENGE
         ================================================================ -->
    <section>
      <heading>The Challenge</heading>
      <body><![CDATA[
<p>Most portfolio sites are built around a single professional identity: "UX Writer," "Technical Writer," or "Content Designer." But my career has never fit neatly into one box. I've written API documentation at AWS, designed in-game reporting systems at Everland, produced live shows for Twitch streamers, and published tabletop game rulebooks.</p>

<p>The challenge was threefold:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Present diverse work without confusion.</strong> A hiring manager looking for a Content Designer shouldn't have to wade through fiction samples, but a game studio should be able to find them easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid the "jack of all trades" perception.</strong> Range is an asset, but only if the portfolio demonstrates depth in each area.</li>
  <li><strong>Build something maintainable.</strong> I needed a system where adding new work wouldn't require restructuring the entire site.</li>
</ol>

<p>Traditional portfolio templates—organized by role or industry—would have forced visitors to pick a lane before exploring. I needed a different approach.</p>

         SECTION 2: INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS
         ================================================================ -->
    <section>
      <heading>Information Architecture: Format Over Role</heading>
      <body><![CDATA[
<p>The key insight was organizing by <em>format</em> rather than <em>role</em>. Instead of categories like "UX Writing" or "Technical Documentation," I created two primary buckets:</p>

<div class="info-box">
  <h3>Case Studies</h3>
  <p>Deep dives into content decisions based on specific objectives. These showcase cross-collaboration, strategic thinking, and measurable outcomes. They answer: <em>"How do you approach complex problems?"</em></p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <h3>Individual Samples</h3>
  <p>Focused pieces demonstrating craft in a particular format without full project context. These answer: <em>"Can you write in this specific style?"</em></p>
</div>

<p>This distinction is about depth and presentation style, not professional specialty. A case study about an in-game reporting system lives alongside one about API documentation. An individual sample of rulebook writing lives alongside one showcasing product documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Hiring managers can quickly find the depth they need. Looking for someone who thinks strategically about content systems? Case Studies. Need to verify someone can write clear API references? Individual Samples. The format-first approach lets my work speak for itself without forcing a professional identity onto the visitor.</p>

         SECTION 3: WHY XML
         ================================================================ -->
    <section>
      <heading>Technical Choice: Why XML Over Markdown</heading>
      <body><![CDATA[
<p>Most static site generators default to Markdown for content. I chose XML instead, and here's why:</p>

<h3>Structured Data, Not Just Text</h3>
<p>Each project isn't just prose—it's structured data with metadata (tags, client, role, thumbnail), a summary, multiple sections, and outcomes. XML makes this structure explicit and enforceable. With Markdown, I'd need frontmatter for metadata and hope I remembered all the fields each time.</p>

<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>XML schemas (XSD files) let me validate content before it breaks the build. If I forget a required field or misname a tag, the validator catches it. Markdown has no equivalent—errors only surface when the page looks wrong.</p>

<h3>AI-Friendly</h3>
<p>When working with AI assistants like Claude, XML's explicit structure makes it easier to generate, modify, and validate content. The AI can work with a clear schema rather than inferring structure from formatting conventions.</p>

<h3>Separation of Concerns</h3>
<p>Content lives in XML. Presentation lives in templates (Nunjucks). Styling lives in CSS. This separation means I can completely redesign the site's appearance without touching content files.</p>

<div class="code-example">
  <h4>Example: Project XML Structure</h4>
  <pre><code>&lt;project&gt;
  &lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;project-slug&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Project Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;tags&gt;
      &lt;tag&gt;Content Design&lt;/tag&gt;
      &lt;tag&gt;Case Study&lt;/tag&gt;
    &lt;/tags&gt;
  &lt;/meta&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Brief overview&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;content&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;heading&gt;Section Title&lt;/heading&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;&lt;![CDATA[HTML content here]]&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/content&gt;
  &lt;outcomes&gt;
    &lt;outcome&gt;Key result&lt;/outcome&gt;
  &lt;/outcomes&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</code></pre>

         SECTION 4: AI-FORWARD WORKFLOW
         ================================================================ -->
    <section>
      <heading>AI-Forward Development Workflow</heading>
      <body><![CDATA[
<p>I built this entire site using Claude as a development partner. This wasn't about replacing my skills—it was about augmenting them. Here's how the collaboration worked:</p>

<h3>Problem-Solving in Natural Language</h3>
<p>When the tag filtering system wasn't updating correctly, I described the behavior I was seeing. Claude helped me trace the issue to a JavaScript event listener that wasn't properly scoped. Instead of spending hours debugging, we solved it in minutes through conversation.</p>

<h3>Context Documents</h3>
<p>I created detailed context files (<code>context.md</code>, <code>TAG-SYSTEM.md</code>, <code>BLOG_IMPLEMENTATION_CONTEXT.md</code>) that explain the architecture, coding standards, and common issues. These serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They help Claude understand the codebase quickly in each session</li>
  <li>They serve as documentation for my future self</li>
</ol>

<h3>Iterative Refinement</h3>
<p>The "Coming Soon" notice you see on placeholder pages went through several iterations. I described what I wanted ("a high visibility container with an SVG icon"), Claude implemented it, I gave feedback ("make the SVG yellow"), and we refined until it matched my vision. This feedback loop is faster than writing CSS from scratch.</p>

<h3>What AI Can't Do</h3>
<p>AI excelled at implementation but couldn't make content decisions. <em>Which projects to feature? How to frame my career narrative? What tone to strike?</em> Those decisions remained mine. The AI was a skilled collaborator, not an autopilot.</p>

         SECTION 5: NAVIGATION DESIGN
         ================================================================ -->
    <section>
      <heading>Navigation Design: Tags for Discovery, Categories for Wayfinding</heading>
      <body><![CDATA[
<p>The site uses two complementary navigation systems:</p>

<h3>Tag Filtering (Desktop Only)</h3>
<p>On desktop, a collapsible filter panel lets visitors narrow projects by up to 5 tags. Tags use AND logic—selecting "Content Design" and "GenAI" shows only projects with both tags. This supports exploratory browsing: <em>"Show me everything involving AI."</em></p>

<h3>Category Navigation (All Devices)</h3>
<p>The sidebar organizes work into Case Studies, Individual Samples, and Content History. This supports directed browsing: <em>"I want to see a full case study."</em></p>

<h3>Why Tags Are Desktop-Only</h3>
<p>On mobile, screen real estate is precious. The tag filter panel would dominate the viewport. More importantly, mobile users typically have a clearer intent—they're less likely to be casually exploring. The category landing pages give mobile users a clear path without the overhead of filtering.</p>

    <!-- ================================================================
         SECTION 6: CONTENT HISTORY - DIFFERENT BY DESIGN
         ================================================================ -->
    <section>
      <heading>Content History: A Different Pattern</heading>
      <body><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="/content-history/">Content History</a> page breaks from the Case Study/Individual Sample pattern intentionally. It's not a portfolio piece—it's a reference document.</p>

<h3>Why It's Different</h3>
<p>Content History serves hiring managers who want breadth, not depth. They're asking: <em>"Who have you worked with? What's your range?"</em> A traditional case study format would bury this information in narrative. Instead, Content History uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A scrolling marquee</strong> of brand/talent logos for immediate visual impact</li>
  <li><strong>Collapsible sections</strong> (Copywriting, Publications, Production) to keep the page scannable</li>
  <li><strong>Card layouts</strong> optimized for quick scanning rather than deep reading</li>
</ul>

<h3>Anchor Links in Navigation</h3>
<p>Unlike other sections, Content History's nav items link to anchors within a single page (<code>#copywriting</code>, <code>#publications</code>, <code>#production</code>) rather than separate pages. This keeps related content together while still allowing direct links.</p>

    <!-- ================================================================
         SECTION 7: RESPONSIVE CONSIDERATIONS
         ================================================================ -->
    <section>
      <heading>Responsive Design Decisions</heading>
      <body><![CDATA[
<p>The site uses a single breakpoint at 768px. Here's what changes and why:</p>

<table class="comparison-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Desktop (&gt;768px)</th>
      <th>Mobile (≤768px)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sidebar</td>
      <td>Fixed 280px, collapsible</td>
      <td>Hidden, hamburger menu</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Right menu</td>
      <td>Sticky navigation</td>
      <td>Hidden</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tag filters</td>
      <td>Collapsible panel</td>
      <td>Hidden</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Project grid</td>
      <td>4 columns</td>
      <td>Responsive auto-fill</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Video hero</td>
      <td>80vh height</td>
      <td>50vh height</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image magnifier</td>
      <td>Hover effect</td>
      <td>Disabled</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Mobile isn't a lesser experience—it's a focused one. Features that require hover states (magnifier, tooltips) don't translate to touch. Features that require screen real estate (tag filters, dual navigation) clutter the mobile viewport. By removing these intentionally, mobile users get a cleaner path to content.</p>
